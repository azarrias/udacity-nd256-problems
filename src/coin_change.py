Coin Change

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. 
Write a function to compute the fewest coins needed to make up that amount. 
If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, 
return -1.

As an example:
    Input: coins = [1, 2, 3], amount = 6
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The output is 2 because we can use 2 coins with value 3. That 
    is, 6 = 3 + 3. We could also use 3 coins with value 2 (that is, 6 = 2 + 2 + 
    2), but this would use more coinsâ€”and the problem specifies we should use 
    the smallest number of coins possible.
